# SEO best practices

## What I've learned about SEO
SEO is the right next step if there is web presence (needed to determine traffic and necessary changes) and if there is enough runway (because SEO is not instant). There two different kinds of SEO to pursue, on-site or off-site SEO. An example of off-site SEO is brand building, to build recognition. An example of on-site SEO is adding content (by adding more pages, or by adding more content to existing pages) to your site.

SEO can be very useful for young sites to determine how to grow their brand and recognition, as well for mature sites to catch up and/or keep up with well established competitors' sites. Something I found interesting was that SEO is not suggested for new start-up sites, because they need results quickly, but have little to work with since they don't have an audience yet. 

## How I would implement SEO on my site
Remove Lorem Ipsum, and replace with real content with keywords for my target audience. 
Create dynamic page titles/icons/images
Add more animation to keep audience interested in content.
Add social media tags for audience to share.
